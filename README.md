This is the classification challange from drivendata.org

## Business Case - 
Using data provided from drivendata.org for the "Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table" Challenge I will be building a model to predict if a well is functional, functional but in the need of a repair, or not functional. Accuracy is what is being judged so this is what my models will be trained for.
